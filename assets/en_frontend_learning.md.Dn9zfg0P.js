React?</summary><p>You can do React if you have a real option to use that knowledge, but it&#39;s much better to expand your developer horizons. Try to write a simple API on the backend. The easiest and most convenient language for this is PHP, but you can also use Node.js or Python. Try JSON-RPC and WebSockets transport protocols. Upload your application to GitHub Pages or another similar service, experiment with GitHub Actions - they help a lot with deploy automation and CI/CD in general. Work with Cloud providers (many offer free resources), set up a virtual server. Register a domain, make a product finished site - even if it&#39;s just your resume site or something basic on VitePress (used by this site). Work with FireStore and open APIs for various data. Check out Swagger. Learn SQL, install MySQL and play around with it, or do it on SupaBase. Understanding how data is stored and processed on the backend will help a lot in choosing the right strategies on the frontend.</p><p>Study how the modern internet works and what technologies and best practices are prevalent on it now.</p></details>',9),n=[s];function i(l,d,u,c,p,h){return t(),a("div",null,n)}const b=e(r,[["render",i]]);export{f as __pageData,b as default};
