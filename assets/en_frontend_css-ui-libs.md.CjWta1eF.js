It&#39;s as if the world went back to the days of IE6, when all styles and JavaScript were also located in tag attributes, and the whole evolution of CSS into a clear, convenient, beautiful hierarchical class model was for nothing, just like the division of the web into document (template), presentation layer (CSS styles) and logic (JavaScript).</p><p>The web is full of articles why an approach like Tailwind is a bad thing. We can only note that with proper skill, layout on pure CSS3 is also fast and much more convenient and pleasant in terms of DX than through CSS and UI libraries.</p><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Quote</p><p>Good developers know the reasons why standards, patterns and good practices have become the way they are.</p><p>Bad developers stick to whatever new trend that might save them some learning curve.</p></div></details>`,5)]))}const m=s(n,[["render",o]]);export{u as __pageData,m as default};
